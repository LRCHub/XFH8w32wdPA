[00:06.58] Battleground's right here
[00:10.76] It's a man's world
[00:15.33] Come on
[00:16.44] Gotta get ready for this right here
[00:18.44] Hey yo
[00:21.44] 
[00:20.19] Fear's awake, anger beats loud
[00:21.69] Face reality
[00:22.50] Never beat charity
[00:23.86] The enemy you're fighting
[00:25.02] Covers all society (Damn right)
[00:26.59] Mommy's not here gotta fight (All night)
[00:28.56] Right here, Shadow ten o'clock direction
[00:30.60] Seize the moment, they destroy the nation
[00:33.16] Your rhyme slow motion, give me motivation
[00:34.57] Freaked out now, and dead on arrival (What?)
[00:36.71] Round up around, spit out, all over
[00:38.71] Rhyme like a rolling stone, coming a crowd
[00:40.67] Watch out, they move, they diss you loud
[00:42.42] Guess what, this sound it bombs whole ground (So round up)
[00:44.73] Don't ease your pace, cause enemy's brutal
[00:46.65] Moment of truth, there ain't no truce
[00:48.27] You're the only one, one world, one love
[00:49.98] But the battle goes on
[00:51.04] Shadows of mass destruction
[01:04.54] 
[00:52.79] Ooh, yeah!
[00:54.75] Dada-dada, dada-dada!

[01:36.18] Hey yo, you guys goin' to rap in this right now?
[01:40.28] Unless we have to
[01:42.28] You can't stop it
[01:44.33] Uh, you guys ready?
[01:46.98] Take it hot, right now
[01:57.98] 
[01:48.30] I thought I told you to sit down or get down
[01:50.31] I'm about to hit ground
[01:51.33] When I'm in the box, my hits way out of this bounds
[01:53.29] Nobody's toppin' me (You know it, damn right)
[01:55.30] Most of y'all lovin' me (Doin' it all night)
[01:57.26] Keepin' my friends close and my foes closer
[01:59.22] Things gettin' messy, but I never lift the nose up
[02:01.27] As I get older, see things slower
[02:03.15] My enemies lookin' like kids, and I'm the grown-up (Forget it)
[02:34.15] 
[02:05.54] I'm the next masterpiece made
[02:07.03] A new generation team, a wicked beast, ace
[02:09.25] But I'm the mister nice guy
[02:10.40] See? I'm a wise guy
[02:11.77] Not a mafioso, but I hustle like Mike
[02:13.56] Lay low if you're feelin' me
[02:15.14] I take these beats
[02:16.29] Freaks, go crazy with me
[02:17.10] So put 'em up in this base with me, and shake with the man
[02:19.58] L to the J's, now follow me, ho!
[02:35.58] 
[02:21.54] Ooh, yeah!
[02:23.37] Dada-dada, dada-dada!
[02:25.89] Baby, baby!
[02:27.38] Dada-dada, dada-dada!
[02:30.03] Ooh, yeah!
[02:31.61] Dada-dada, dada-dada!
[02:33.95] Baby, baby!
[02:35.53] Dada-dada, dada!
[02:43.53] 
[02:37.75] Ooh, yeah!
[02:39.63] Dada-dada, dada-dada!
[02:42.15] Baby, baby!
[02:43.68] Dada-dada, dada-dada!
[02:46.16] Ooh, yeah!
[02:47.78] Dada-dada, dada-dada!
[02:50.12] Baby, baby!
[02:51.75] Dada-dada, dada!
